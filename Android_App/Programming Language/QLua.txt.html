You can edit a Lua file in the editor

[QLua app]
- Click button Editor
- [Top bar, right side]
- Click button New File, looks like a page with a Plus sign
- [New file]
- Click option Blank file -> Closes dialog
- Enter some text
- [Bottom bar]
- Click button Save, looks like a 3.5" floppy disk
- Note: The file gets saved in the folder /sdcard/qlua5

You can run a Lua program in the editor

[QLua app]
- Open file
- [Bottom bar]
- Click button Run, looks like a right-arrow play button
- [console window]
- The top line shows the current path and the Linux shell command used to show the editor
- The output of your program is below the first line

Lua programs have a specific syntax

[Lua console]
- Note: The right-arrow symbol (greater-than sign) is the Lua prompt
- Note: Comment line-endings in a Lua file are separated by two hyhpens

```
--Single-line comment
ur_object.ur_function() --Comment until end of line
```

- Note: Multi-line comments in a Lua file are separated by two hyphens and two open brackets, and closed by two hyphens and two close brackets

```
--[[
Block comment
multiple lines
--]]
```

- Note: Commands in Lua are case sensitive

- Note: You can exit the Lua interpreter by the command os.exit()
- Note: You can exit the Linux shell by the command exit


You can run the Lua program in the console

[Lua console]
- Save the result of the loadfile command to create a new function from the file

```
urfile_fn=loadfile('/sdcard/qlua5/ur_file.lua')
```

- Note: This added a row to the _G table
- Note: Just typing a function name or a table name shows the type of data stored in the row

```
_G.urfile
```

- Output is 'function: 0x#####'
- Note: any command except _G is an implied name lookup in the _G table

```
urfile
```

- Output is also the same `function: 0x####'
- Run the function to load additional functions into the _G table

```
urfile()
```

- Output is the Lua program output
- Note: Any functions or tables added to the _G table are available

You can load a Lua function and run it on the same line

[Lua prompt]
- Use the loadfile command to load the file as a function, and add an extra pair of parentheses

```
loadfile('/sdcard/qlua5/ur_file.lua')()
```

- Output is the Lua program output

You can load a file placed in the share/5.3 directory

[File Manager]
- Navigate to /sdcard/qlua
- Create subfolders share/5.3
- Copy your .lua program into the /sdcard/qlua/share/5.3 folder

[Lua console]
- Use the require command to load and run the program

```
require 'ur_file'
```

- Output is the Lua program output
