Any letters from c through n (except l) are the represented numbers
- c = 0, e through k = 1 through 7, m through n = 8 through 9
- Start with "specc"
- Take letters c through n -> "ecc"
- Translate to numbers -> "100"

Any letters from o through z are used in different sequences depending on the starting letters
- s = one number following (0 through 9)
- so = two numbers following (10 through 99)
- sp = three numbers following (100 through 999)
- t = four numbers following
	- t is followed by one number, then an s followed by three numbers
- to = five numbers following
- tp = six numbers following
- u = seven numbers following
	- u is followed by one number, then a t followed by three numbers, then an s followed by three numbers
- uo = eight numbers following
- up = nine numbers following
- wq = ten numbers following
	- wq is followed by one number, then a u and three numbers, a t and three numbers, then an s and three numbers

The rest of the numbers start with a y and represent multiples of 10 digits
- size digitis are: o through w = 0 through 8, z = 9
- y = one size digit (p through z), then an l, then a ten-digit number starting with wq
	- then a single y, followed by the next size before the first one (o through w), then an l, then a ten-digit number
	- repeat until y is followed by ol and a ten-digit number
- yy = two size digits (p0 through zz), then an l, then a ten-digit number starting with wq
	- then a single y, followed by the next y-size before the first one (z through zw), then an l, then a ten-digit number
	- repeat until y is followed by ol and a ten-digit number
- continue repeating the first y as needed

The leading number of y's plus the l separator gives the number of digits in the exponent
