Can anyone who understands the boot loader help me figure out why this rename would have worked for everything except the data-tiddlers? 

I downloaded an empty version of TW and used Notepad++ to rename all the "tiddler", "Tiddler", and "TIDDLER" text to "card", "Card", and "CARD" respectively. It loaded and ran, but did not save the data-tiddlers (now data cards). I wanted to see if it was really that simple of a change.

It worked fine except for re-saving the wiki file does not include any data-tiddlers. Thus the re-saved wiki file does not do anything on open. Specifically, I can see the filter="[is[system]]" does find find these four data-tiddlers when I load the standard code, and they are missing when I load the "card" version.

$:/library/sjcl.js
$:/boot/bootprefix.js
$:/boot/boot.js
$:/boot/boot.css

I imagine they are actually being loaded because the rest of the program works. I tried stepping through the Javascript, and I just don't know the structures well enough to follow what's happening.

Hi Thomas

I created a similar script last year to experiment with things, but I’m also finding that it’s broken with more recent versions of TW.  I haven’t got time to experiment with it now, but I’ve attached the script below in case it’s helpful,

Best wishes

Jeremy
