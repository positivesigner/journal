When GitHub Desktop is installed, the Git.exe program is placed in the %APPDATA% folder. There is one sub-directory for each version of Git that has been downloaded. Look for the latest version-numbered folder.

C:\Users\UrUser\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\app-UrVersion

Under the app-UrVersion folder, find the Git.exe program

app-UrVersion\resources\app\git\cmd\git.exe
